# Version 2 adds data persistence into YelpCamp
    - Takes away the pre-existing array of campsites
    - Includes campsites in a database using MongoDB
    - Users are now able to add their own campsites into the database using basic campsite form
    - Main page refreshes and shows the additional campsites once user confirms input
